# core-dev
Core development files for front end development with Sass using NPM versus a build tool like Grunt, Gulp or Webpack.  Simple html, css and js boilerplate.  This project extends the [HTML5 Boilerplate(https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate "HTML5 Boilerplate")] project. 

## NPM vs Build Process
The reason I chose to use NPM versus a build process is because build processes appear to me to add bloat. They also can be difficult introduce new ones if, for instance, you need a newer version of node than your current build process allows.  By using NPM scripts, you avoid having any dependencies other than the versions of Node and NPM you want to use.
